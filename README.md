7pace Kitten Timer is a lightweight time management tool that helps you and your team increase productivity. Inspired by the Pomodoro Technique® *, the 7pace Kitten features set intervals of uninterrupted work, followed by short breaks, and ultimately longer breaks after the completion of four intervals or “rounds”.

With seamless integration into 7pace Timetracker, you simply set the timer, concentrate solely on the task at hand for the specified stretch of time, and then enjoy a restorative break when the interval has ended! The 7pace Kitten helps keep the team focused, on task, builds more efficient work habits, and helps eliminate procrastination.

Features of the 7pace Kitten include:
* Ability to set notifications when your round or break is finished, even if your browser tab is closed
* Ability to receive notifications when your team members are on a “break”
* Configurable length of rounds and breaks
* Customizable sound notifications
* **Integration with 7pace Timetracker**
* **Team status overview**
* **Fun “Badges” as you reach milestones within the timer** 
* **Free for you and your team!**
